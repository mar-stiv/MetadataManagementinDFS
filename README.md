# Project 4: Metadata Management in Distributed File System (DFS)


## Overview
Our project implements a metadata management module for a Distributed File System. It simulates how modern DFSs (such as HDFS, Ceph, etc) organise and distribute metadata across multiple metadata servers.

## Next steps
- Arnaud: implement the TCP/Socket connection: check the code generated by copilot (Arnaud: understand
- Maria: implement the B+ tree in the code: how do we code such a tree, is there a library or package that already exists for B+ trees?
- implement all the functions

## Following steps
- implement all the functions: mkdir, touch, chkdist, tree, fulltree, rmdir, cd, rm, rm ../myFile, ls, stat myFile, stat myDirectory, chmod
- if a metadata server stops running, we still have to be able to use the other servers
- we have to be able to restart that server and use it again
- we have to be able to interrupt and restart the cluster server
